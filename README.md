# rct

A library that helps you write modern React components in Clojurescript however you like. 

As the layer between ClojureScript and React, `rct` aims to be minimal and powerful - it should introduce as little abstraction as possible to smooth the boundary and give the user as much control as possible to leverage that abstraction.

## API

The `rct` API consists of two open protocols, each with a single method:
- `ReactComponent`
    - `as-component`
- `ReactElement`
    - `as-element`

You can call the methods to conform data to a native React Component and React Element. You do this when _providing_ data to native code (for example, when rendering your root element to the DOM). 

You can extend the protocols to use new data types as React Components, like CLJS maps for class-based components, and React Elements, like CLJS vectors for Hiccup-style templates (included!).

Note that you don't have to "adapt" native Components to use them - these ReactComponent implementations are already provided in the library.

## Rationale

There are a handful of existing libraries for writing React components in Clojurescript, like [Reagent](https://github.com/reagent-project/reagent), [Rum](https://github.com/tonsky/rum), and [Om](https://github.com/omcljs/om). All of these provide features for defining React components using DSLs and managing reactive state. The closest relative of this library is probably [hx](https://github.com/Lokeh/hx) - both `hx` and `rct` try to give the user the best tool for writing modern React components, and explicitly leave state management out of scope. The main differentiating factor for `rct` is that the API is smaller and more extensible. 

## Stateful Components

React 16.8 brought us [Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html), which let you access the all the rich state and lifecycle APIs from functional components. This greatly improves the ergonomics for developers looking to build stateful React apps in idiomatic Clojure. `rct` provides wrappers to some of these in `rct.hooks`. 

## Examples

### Hello World
```clojure
(ns rct.example.hello-world
    (:require ["react-dom" :as react-dom]
              [rct.core :refer [as-element]]))

(defn hello []
   [:p {:style {:color "blue"}} "Hello World"]) 

(react-dom/render
    (as-element [hello])
    (.-body js/document))
```

### Function Component using Props
```clojure
(defn function-component [{:keys [message]}]
   [:p {:style {:color "blue"}} message])

(react-dom/render
    (as-element [function-component {:message "Hi, Function Component!"}])
    (.-body js/document))
```

### Stateful Component using React Hook
```clojure
(ns rct.example.counter
    (:require ["react-dom" :as react-dom]
              [rct.core :refer [as-element]]
              [rct.hooks :refer [use-state]]))

(defn counter [{:keys [init]}]
  (let [[v set-v] (use-state init)]
      [:<>
       [:p {} (str "Count: " v)]
       [:button {:onClick #(-> v inc set-v)} "Click to Increment"]]))

(react-dom/render 
    (r/as-element [counter {:init 0}]) 
    (.-body js/document))
```

#### Feedback?

Feel free to email, find me on Clojurians (@anson), or post an issue :) I think this could probably reach a very useful stable state with some more polish on the Hooks wrappers and a `ReactComponent` impl that lets you write class-based components as CLJS maps.
